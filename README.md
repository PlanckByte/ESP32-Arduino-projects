# ESP32-Arduino-projects

Overview

This repository contains a collection of Arduino-based projects developed during my time at CommonsLab, a Social Cooperative Enterprise dedicated to IoT and automation solutions. Many of these projects were created for experimental purposes, troubleshooting, or testing various sensors and configurations. Others, such as the Weather Station, were deployed in practical applications, including the Valdibella ATTESTED pilot under the EU-funded DRG4FOOD Open Call.

Purpose

The projects are intended to:

    Demonstrate experiments with sensor integration and Arduino programming.
    Provide examples of troubleshooting and optimization for embedded systems.
    Showcase practical implementations like the weather station used in agricultural traceability and monitoring.
